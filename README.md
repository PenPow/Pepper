We would love for everyone to be able to help develop and maintain Pepper as much as possible! This section is a list of all the ways that you can help us work on Pepper, and ensure the code is not only up to a high quality, but also as feature rich as possible.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to join our support server and ask our project maintainers any questions you may have.

### Ideas and discussion
If you ever have an idea for a new command, please create a discussion describing it. The project maintainers will take a look at it, and maybe even add it into Pepper!

In addition to this, you can provide your own insights and thoughts about suggested ideas by leaving a comment on the discussion page! We always love to be given criticism and review so we can ensure Pepper is up to standards.
